## How the code works
### 1. **Form submission**
- [x] The frontend collects user input through a form with six rating categories (skills, availability, communication, quality, deadlines, cooperation) and a comments section.
- [ ] When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the backend via an API request using **Axios**.
### 2. **Final rating calculation**
- [ ] The backend stores the final rating in MongoDb.
- [x] The frontend displays the final rating to the user after a successful submission.
### 3. **Styling with Tailwind CSS**
- [x] The app uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, which provides utility classes for rapid UI development.
- [ ] Components are styled directly in the JSX using Tailwind classes, making the code clean and easy to maintain.
