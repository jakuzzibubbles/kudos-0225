# KudosðŸ™‚
Introduction

Kudos is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate peer reviews and ratings for employees and freelancers. The project serves as a foundational learning experience for implementing DevOps practices while developing a functional web application.

Deployment & DevOps

The deployment setup is still in progress and follows standard DevOps practices:

AWS for hosting and infrastructure: The application is planned to be deployed on AWS for scalability.

Docker for containerization: The frontend and backend services are containerized using Docker to ensure consistency across environments.

Jenkins and GitHub Actions for CI/CD: CI/CD pipelines are being set up for automated testing and deployment.

Kubernetes for orchestration: Kubernetes is being explored to manage containers and automate deployment.

The goal is to set up a functional and maintainable deployment pipeline while learning best practices along the way.

## How the code works
### 1. **Form submission**
- [x] The frontend collects user input through a form with six rating categories (skills, availability, communication, quality, deadlines, cooperation) and a comments section.
- [ ] When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the backend via an API request using **Axios**.
### 2. **Final rating calculation**
- [ ] The backend stores the final rating in MongoDb.
- [x] The frontend displays the final rating to the user after a successful submission.
### 3. **Styling with Tailwind CSS**
- [x] The app uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, which provides utility classes for rapid UI development.
- [ ] Components are styled directly in the JSX using Tailwind classes, making the code clean and easy to maintain.
### 4. **User Authentication**
- [ ] Users can log in or create an account.
- [ ] After logging in, users are redirected to the dashboard.
### 5. **Dashboard**
- [ ] Users can see their received reviews.
- [ ] Users can send reviews to employers.

## Key components
### 1. **App component (`src/App.jsx`)**
- [x] The main component that handles routing and redirects.
### 2. **Login component (`src/pages/Auth/Login.jsx`)**
- [x] Handles user login and redirects to the dashboard.
### 3. **Dashboard component (`src/pages/Auth/Home/Dashboard.jsx`)**
- [x] Displays received reviews and provides a form to send reviews.
### 4. **ReviewList component (`src/components/ReviewList.jsx`)**
- [x] Displays a list of received reviews.
### 5. **SendReviewForm component (`src/components/SendReviewForm.jsx`)**
- [x] Provides a form to send reviews to employers.
### 6. **FormInput component (`src/components/FormInput.jsx`)**
- [x] Reusable input component for form fields.
### 7. **StarRating component (`src/components/StarRating.jsx`)**
- [x] Reusable component for star rating input.
### 8. **FormSection component (`src/components/FormSection.jsx`)**
- [x] Reusable component for form sections.
### 9. **useFormData hook (`src/hooks/useFormData.js`)**
- [x] Custom hook to manage form data and handle changes.
### 2. **Tailwind CSS (`src/index.css`)**
- [x] Imports Tailwindâ€™s base, components, and utilities for styling.
- [ ] Ensures consistent and responsive design across devices.
### 3. **Axios for API requests**
- [ ] Used to send form data to the backend and receive the final rating.
- [ ] Handles errors and displays alerts to the user.
---
## Backend setup
### 1. **Server setup (`backend/server.js`)**
- [x] Sets up the Express server and connects to MongoDB.
### 2. **Review model (`backend/models/Review.js`)**
- [x] Defines the schema for storing reviews in MongoDB.
### 3. **Review controller (`backend/controllers/reviewController.js`)**
- [x] Handles the logic for retrieving and creating reviews.
### 4. **Review routes (`backend/routes/reviewRoutes.js`)**
- [x] Defines the API endpoints for reviews.

### Tasks that still need to be done:
1. **Styling with Tailwind CSS**
   - [ ] Ensure components are styled directly in the JSX using Tailwind classes, making the code clean and easy to maintain.
   - [ ] Ensure consistent and responsive design across devices.

2. **User Authentication**
   - [ ] Implement user login and account creation.
   - [ ] Redirect users to the dashboard after logging in.

3. **Dashboard**
   - [ ] Display received reviews to users.
   - [ ] Allow users to send reviews to employers.

4. **Axios for API requests**
   - [ ] Handle errors and display alerts to the user.

## Deployment
- [ ] Use AWS for hosting and infrastructure.
- [ ] Use Docker for containerization.
- [ ] Use Jenkins and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- [ ] Use Kubernetes for orchestration.
